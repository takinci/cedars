# CEDARS — Sources and Assumption Governance

CEDARS stores uncertain literature values as transparent, editable defaults with citation fields. Local measured data — procurement records, utility bills, scanner logs, PACS/cloud invoices, and country-specific carbon factors — should replace defaults wherever available.

## AI model library (`AI_MODEL_LIBRARY`) and performance governance

The AI Dashboard ships a library of task-family templates spanning the real space of radiology AI. **Each template is an editable starting point, not an authoritative spec.** The fields divide into two categories with very different epistemic status:

- **Energy drivers** (`paramsM`, `dim`, `resolution`, `slices`, `inferSec`, `gpuKw`, `trainMwh`, `embCo2Kg`) — physically grounded. Inference time auto-scales with `params × resolution² (× slices for 3D)` relative to the template's measured base; energy then follows from GPU power, PUE, and precision. These are defensible *relative* estimates anchored to a real datapoint, not absolute FLOPs claims.
- **Performance fields** (`accuracyPct`, `accuracyMetric`, `scanTimeReductPct`, `lowValueReductPct`) — **NOT predicted by CEDARS.** They default to the cited reference's reported value and are presented as editable, user-owned numbers. CEDARS never infers accuracy from model size or architecture; the user must enter their own validation results for any published figure.

**Governing principle:** carbon/energy may be modelled (it is physics); model *performance* may only be recorded (it is not predictable from architecture). The accuracy-vs-carbon trade-off the dashboard surfaces is therefore a comparison of *user-supplied* performance under a consistent carbon methodology.

**Template reference anchors** (defaults only — replace with your own measured GPU-hours, inference time, and validation metrics):

## Intervention savings defaults

Baseline kWh savings in `INTERVENTIONS` are conservative departmental estimates informed by the sources below. Replace with measured before/after metering.

| Intervention | Basis |
|-------------|-------|
| Turn MRI/CT off overnight | JMRI-2023 and Radiol-243453: idle draws of 15 kW over 8 h/night on MRI alone = 120 kWh/night × ~20 nights ≈ 2 400 kWh/month. |
| Standby mode during inactive periods | Herrmann-2012 and CJRS-2022: standby typically 40–60 % lower than idle; ~1 200 kWh/month estimated saving across MRI + CT fleet. |
| Reduce low-value imaging | McKee-2024 and ESR-PP-2025: reducing 5–10 % unnecessary scans; ~800 kWh/month estimated. |
| Optimise scheduling | IJHCQA-2016: tighter scheduling reduces dead-time idle; ~600 kWh/month. |
| Shorten protocols | Radiol-230441: protocol compression reduces per-scan active time; ~450 kWh/month. |
| Reduce repeat scans | AJR-2023-CT: each avoided CT ≈ 0.5 kWh; reducing repeats by ~1 800/month = 900 kWh/month. |
| Move computation to lower-carbon region | OWID-CI: same energy, grid swap from 0.38 to 0.06–0.10 kgCO₂e/kWh = up to 80 % CO₂ reduction on compute. |
| Use renewable electricity | ESR-GI: Scope 2 decarbonisation via green tariff or PPA; effectively zeroes grid carbon. |
| Reduce paper and film printing | Radiol-240398: film processor and laser printer loads ~120 kWh/month in typical department. |
| Extend hardware lifetime | ESR-PP-2025: embodied carbon amortised over more years; ~15 % Scope 3 reduction. |
| Consolidate servers | Clinical-AI: virtualisation / right-sizing reduces physical server count; ~500 kWh/month. |
| Use smaller or more efficient AI models | LLM-Energy: lighter models use substantially less inference compute; ~80 kWh/month. |

## Scope 3 metrics: staff commute, DICOM data transfer, and Software Carbon Intensity

These three metrics were added to CEDARS based on gaps identified in Doo et al. JACR 2024 relative to common departmental reporting practice.

| ID | Citation |
|----|---------|
| Doo-JACR-2024 | See Radiology sustainability section. Framework source for including staff commute and DICOM data transfer in departmental Scope 3, and for the per-study SCI metric. All three are described as actionable Scope 3 additions that most departments currently omit. |
| DEFRA-2023 | See Equivalencies section. Staff commute emission factor: **0.17 kgCO₂e/km** (average petrol passenger car, round trip). Used in `staffCommuteCo2`: `staffCount × commuteKm × 2 × STAFF_DAYS_PER_MO × timeMult × 0.17`. |

DOI: [10.1111/jiec.12630](https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.12630). Fixed-line data-centre network average: **0.001 kWh/GB** (NET_KWH_PER_GB). Used for DICOM network transfer CO₂: `imagingScans × 0.3 GB/study × 0.001 kWh/GB × gridCI`. Note: covers data-centre network segment only; last-mile and end-user device energy not included. |
| GSF-SCI | Green Software Foundation. *Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) Specification v1.0.* https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/software-carbon-intensity. DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.8369519](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8369519). Formula: **SCI = (E × I + M) / R** where E = operational energy (kWh), I = carbon intensity (kgCO₂e/kWh), M = embodied carbon, R = functional unit (one imaging study). Used in the "SCI — carbon per imaging study" card in the Dashboard. Cited alongside Doo-JACR-2024 as the standard metric for per-study carbon reporting. |

**Staff count estimation from device fleet (`STAFF_PER_DEVICE`):**

Staff commute headcount is derived automatically from the equipment configuration using NHS/British Institute of Radiology (BIR) workforce planning ratios. These represent whole-department FTE (radiologists, radiographers, nurses, physicists, admin, IT) per active device unit — not technologist-only counts. These are indicative defaults; replace with actual HR data for publication.

| Device type | FTE/unit | Basis |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| MRI (0.35T) | 4 | Simple open-bore, less complex workflow |
| MRI (1.5T / 3T) | 5 | Standard clinical MRI; BIR staffing norms |
| MRI (7T) | 6 | Research / specialist; additional physicists |
| CT | 4 | Standard clinical CT |
| PET-CT | 5 | Specialist techs + radiologist + physicist |
| Angio / IR suite | 6 | Radiologist + 2–3 techs/nurses + scrub |
| Fluoroscopy | 3 | Shared tech + radiologist |
| X-ray room | 3 | 1–2 radiographers + shared radiologist |
| Ultrasound | 2 | Sonographer + shared radiologist |
| Mammography | 2 | Radiographer + shared radiologist |
| PACS / Servers | 2 | IT support staff |
| Workstations | 1 | One reading radiologist per station |

## Contrast media and contamination (`CONTRAST`)

Estimates the iodinated (ICM — CT, PET-CT, angiography, fluoroscopy) and gadolinium-based (GBCA — MRI) contrast footprint from the fleet's per-modality exam counts × fixed literature defaults. Two distinct concerns: **waste** (contrast drawn but discarded) and **contamination** (administered contrast excreted by patients into wastewater). Both agent classes pass through wastewater treatment largely unremoved, so environmental release ≈ administered dose (a defensible mass-balance).

> ⚠️ **Verification status:** the numeric defaults below are literature-informed midpoints entered from domain knowledge; the dedicated verification pass was halted. Treat them as *editable defaults to be confirmed against the cited primary sources and local pharmacy/procurement data* before publication. Contrast-use fractions in particular vary widely by institution and indication.

**Default parameters (`CONTRAST`):**

| Parameter | Default | Basis / to verify |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| % CT with contrast | 40% | Institution-dependent; ~30–50% typical. **[verify]** |
| % PET-CT with contrast | 30% | CT component often low-dose/non-contrast. **[verify]** |
| % Angio/IR with contrast | 90% | Most interventional procedures are contrast-based. **[verify]** |
| % Fluoroscopy with contrast | 50% | Indication-dependent. **[verify]** |
| % MRI with gadolinium | 35% | ~30–45% of MRI use GBCA. **[verify]** |
| Iodinated volume | 100 mL/exam | Typical CT contrast bolus 50–150 mL. **[verify]** |
| Iodine concentration | 350 mgI/mL | Common agents 300–370 mgI/mL. |
| Gadolinium per exam | ~1.0 g Gd | Standard 0.1 mmol/kg × ~70 kg = 7 mmol × 157 g/mol ≈ 1.1 g. |
| GBCA volume | 15 mL/exam | ~15 mL of a 0.5 M macrocyclic agent. |
| Waste fraction | 10% | Overfill / leftover discarded; multi-dose vials & weight-based dosing reduce it. **[verify]** |
| Contrast density | 1.4 g/mL | For discarded-mass (hazardous-waste) estimate. |

**Environmental / methodology references (to cite and verify):**

| ID | Citation |
|----|---------|
| Gd-Environment | Gadolinium as an emerging "anthropogenic gadolinium" contaminant — GBCA passes through wastewater treatment essentially unremoved and is measurable in surface water, groundwater, and drinking water. E.g. Rogowska J et al. *Environ Sci Technol* 2018 (anthropogenic gadolinium in the aquatic environment); Brünjes R & Hofmann T, *Water Res* 2020 (Gd anomalies in rivers/tap water). **[verify exact refs/DOIs]** |
| ICM-Environment | Iodinated contrast media are highly persistent, mobile organic pollutants; renally excreted largely unchanged within 24 h and poorly removed in treatment, forming iodinated disinfection by-products. Reviews of ICM occurrence in the aquatic environment. **[verify exact refs/DOIs]** |
| Contrast-Stewardship | Contrast optimisation / stewardship (weight-based dosing, multi-dose/bulk vials, appropriate ordering, agent selection) reduces both waste and environmental release. ESR sustainability guidance; ACR/vendor contrast-optimisation literature. **[verify]** |

**Co-benefit note:** reducing unnecessary contrast-enhanced imaging cuts patient risk (contrast reactions, gadolinium retention) *and* environmental contamination — a "sustainable = higher-value care" lever, linked to the appropriateness framing in the intervention set. A contrast-media **carbon (LCA)** figure is deliberately **not** reported yet: per-mL life-cycle CO₂e factors for contrast are sparse and would need a sourced LCA before inclusion; the resource/contamination masses above are more defensible.

## Assumption principles

1. **Prefer measured data.** Energy from scanner logs, smart meters, facility meters, or cloud invoices always overrides literature defaults.
2. **Literature values are transparent defaults**, not authoritative truth.
3. **Mark every input** as `measured`, `estimated`, or `assumed` (see confidence field in dashboard CSV).
4. **Carbon intensity must be editable and region-specific.** National averages underestimate variation by utility or time of day.
5. **Separate AI gross footprint from estimated sustainability benefits.** Net AI impact can be negative (net-positive) if AI reduces unnecessary scans.
6. **Report Scope 1, 2, and 3 separately** where the data model supports it. The Scope 1/2/3 structure follows the GHG Protocol as applied to radiology departments by **Doo-JACR-2024**. Scope 3 inclusions (embodied carbon, patient travel, staff commute, DICOM data transfer) are drawn from that framework.
7. **Update defaults annually** as grids decarbonise and scanner technology improves.
8. **AI lifecycle reporting follows Doo-JACR-2024 §4.** Training (Phase 1), testing/validation (Phase 2), and inference/deployment (Phase 3) are the three phases. Per-study Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) per the Green Software Foundation specification is the recommended single-number comparison metric for AI tools.
9. **Model energy may be modelled; model performance may only be recorded.** AI inference/training energy is estimated from physical drivers (parameters, resolution, dimensionality, GPU power, PUE). Diagnostic performance (accuracy, Dice, AUC, etc.) and clinical co-benefits are **never predicted** — they default to a cited reference and must be replaced with the user's own validation results. See the AI model library section.
