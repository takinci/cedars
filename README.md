## What is CEDARS?

CEDARS (Carbon, Energy Diagnostics for AI and Radiology Sustainability) is a browser-based sustainability dashboard for clinical radiology departments. It quantifies the environmental impact of imaging operations, compares interventions, models AI tool footprints, and generates shareable reports — all from published literature defaults that you can override with your own measured data.

No installation. No backend. No data leaves your browser.

## What can it do?

### 🔋 Radiology Sustainability Dashboard

Five metric categories, fully reactive to your region, department profile, and time period:

| Category | What it tracks |
|---|---|
| **1. Energy consumption** | Total kWh/MWh, active vs idle breakdown, avoidable idle, energy per scan |
| **2. Carbon emissions** | GHG Protocol Scope 1 (direct), Scope 2 (electricity), Scope 3 (hardware embodied + patient travel) with stacked bar chart |
| **3. Infrastructure** | Top idle waster, hardware lifespans, carbon intensity, Scope 3 total, top-5 opportunity table |
| **4. Resource footprint** | Water (L/kWh cooling), paper consumption (g/encounter), hazardous waste (contrast media) |
| **5. Real-world equivalencies** | Car km, phone charges, tree-years to offset, short-haul flights (ICAO 2023), household electricity years |

### 🤖 AI Sustainability Dashboard

Three-phase lifecycle model for a radiology AI tool:

| Phase | Metrics |
|---|---|
| **Training** | Total kWh (one-time), CO₂e, estimated GPU hours, amortised per month |
| **Testing / validation** | Hold-out set energy, CO₂e, proxy metric note (DLP/CTDIvol R²=0.87–0.92) |
| **Inference & deployment** | Per-study energy, monthly and lifetime totals, water footprint |

Plus: Green AI efficiency ratio (accuracy % per kWh), PUE, embodied GPU carbon, rebound effect risk, and a full modality energy benchmark table (Vosshenrich et al.).

Selectable **architecture** (CNN, U-Net, EfficientNet, ViT, Diffusion/Generative), **model size**, **precision** (float32 / float16 AMP), and **cloud provider**.

### 📊 Scenario Comparison

Pick from 12 evidence-based interventions and see the before/after energy and carbon impact:

> Turn MRI/CT off overnight · Standby mode · Reduce low-value imaging · Shorten protocols · Renewable electricity · Move computation to lower-carbon region · Use smaller AI models · Consolidate servers · and more

### 📤 Export

Download a CSV report or print to PDF with a clean print-optimised layout. The export page includes key assumption citations so reports are audit-ready.

## Who is it for?

- **Radiologists and clinical leads** — understand the footprint of your department and identify quick wins
- **Sustainability officers** — generate Scope 1/2/3 estimates and intervention comparisons for ESG reporting
- **Medical physicists** — benchmark scanner energy against published literature
- **AI governance teams** — model the lifecycle carbon footprint of a radiology AI tool before deployment
- **Academic researchers** — explore and cite the evidence base, export data for publications
- **Healthcare executives** — communicate sustainability performance in accessible equivalencies (car km, flights, tree-years)

---

## Assumptions and governance

1. Prefer measured data — scanner logs, smart meters, utility bills always override defaults
2. Literature values are transparent defaults, not authoritative truth
3. Mark every input as *measured*, *estimated*, or *assumed*
4. Carbon intensity must be editable and region-specific
5. Separate AI gross footprint from estimated sustainability benefits
6. Report Scope 1, 2, and 3 separately

See [sources.md](./sources.md) for the full assumptions governance document.
